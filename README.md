# Emacs Configuration File: init.el

by Brendan Wakefield (2019)

### Useful Information

I primarily use Emacs as a Python IDE, so most of my configuration file is
set up to accomodate this. I use the [MELPA] (https://melpa.org/#/) package
repository (necessary to get elpy), and things have been much easier since
Emacs 26.3 was released. So check your Emacs version if you're trying to
clone my setup.
